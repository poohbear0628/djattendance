'''
Pseudo-code for algo


-----
Hard-constraint

Get all the services without day (repeating services) + date falls within this coming week
Get all the workergroups + roles + count (related to services)

duplicate services node with multiple count for workergroups (single instance)

Get all workers?

Create edges based on worker.services_needed

check only 1 service per day, weekday
check conflicting services on same day -> flow into a single bottle-neck node

--------
Trim operation?
Apply exceptions to trim workers from services

All pre-assigned, take out of the graph (designated, shuttle, etc.), if
assignment counts as service, trim all other services that day

how to check for time conflict
All pinned assignments -> check time conflict but not count as +1 service?

All time conflict will be caused only by irregular services
(piano, AV, Shuttle, Outline Sisters)


------
special operation

to choose star assignments for duo star assignments
flip coin for brother/sister and create edges

-------
Soft-constraint (edges cost)

Calculate the cost for the edges

pull history, health

health (base weight of trainee -> sink)
history (+1 for each service already done before), more weight, closer to current date (3 weeks?)
(visualize it for SS) experience (-0.5 for each service already done before)
noise (+- noise for randomly in the cost run each time)? maybe optional

ServiceSlot.workload (base weight of each trainee -> service)




-------
star assignment -> maybe greedy trim star edges and then
randomly flip coins to ratio of brother/sister star ratio
and trim graph appropriately

(future dev) -> Maybe incorporate how constrained each star in the flipping
probabilities to bias less constrained stars
