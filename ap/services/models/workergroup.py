'''
Will either be a filter workergroup or manual workergroup

WorkerGroup can created via:

 - filter
  - http://ap.ftta.lan/api/trainees/term/2/?format=json&terms%5B%5D=2&terms%5B%5D=3&hc=false

 - manual assignment
 - doodle

Assignments may be
 - static
 - rotational
 - weekly manual assignment


Inherits from Group:
 - name          Required. 80 characters or fewer. Any characters are permitted. Example: 'Awesome Users'.
 - permissions   Many-to-many field to Permission:



?? TODO: make workgroup have types, (e.g. designated)

IMPORTANT!!!: For the sake of performance, make sure to make very few
workergroups that are shared among many services (no duplicates!),
b/c it's very expensive to fetch users from db using query

Using explicit worker definition is way faster (optimization-wise) than filters as they can be fetched in bulk in the beginning
